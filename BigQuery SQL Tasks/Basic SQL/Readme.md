# Task 3 : Query Validation
###  Task 3.1 

Your colleague has written a query to find the highest sales connected to special offers. The query works fine but the numbers are off, investigate where the potential issue lies.

```
SELECT

  sales_detail.OrderQty,
  ROUND(sales_detail.UnitPrice,2) AS UnitPrice,
  ROUND(sales_detail.LineTotal,2) AS LineTotal,
  sales_detail.ProductId,
  sales_detail.SpecialOfferID,
  spec_offer.Category,
  spec_offer.Description
FROM
  tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.salesorderdetail AS sales_detail
LEFT JOIN
  tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.specialofferproduct AS spec_offer_product
ON
  sales_detail.productId = spec_offer_product.ProductID
LEFT JOIN
  tc-da-1.adwentureworks_db.specialoffer AS spec_offer
ON
  sales_detail.SpecialOfferID = spec_offer.SpecialOfferID
ORDER BY
  LineTotal desc
```

###  Task 3.2 

Your colleague has written this query to collect basic Vendor information. The query does not work, look into the query and find ways to fix it. Can you provide any feedback on how to make this query be easier to debug/read?

```
SELECT

  vendor_contact.ContactID AS ContactID,
  vendor_contact.ContactTypeID AS Contact_type_id,
  vendor.Name AS vendor_name,
  vendor.CreditRating AS Credit_ratting,
  vendor.ActiveFlag AS Active,
  vendor_address.AddressID AS addressID,
  address.City
FROM
  `adwentureworks_db.vendor` AS vendor
LEFT JOIN
  `adwentureworks_db.vendorcontact` AS vendor_contact
ON
  vendor.VendorID = vendor_contact.VendorID
LEFT JOIN
  `adwentureworks_db.vendoraddress` AS vendor_address
ON
  vendor.VendorID = vendor_address.VendorID
LEFT JOIN
  `adwentureworks_db.address` AS address
ON
  vendor_address.AddressID = address.AddressID
