# Customer Segmentation & RFM

In a constantly growing business, understanding your customers behavior is one of the most important parts for success. This is where customer segmentation and RFM steps in. Segmentation means sorting your customers into groups who are similar, so we can treat them uniquely by the groups they are assigned. RFM is like looking at a customer's shopping habits - how recently they bought (R), how often (F), and how much they spend (M). By doing this, we can find out who your best customers are, how to engage those customers who haven't shopped in a while, and make your marketing campaigns even better. These tools help businesses understand customers like never before, making relationships stronger and businesses more successful.

In this project I received the RFM dataset with information about the customer invoices, when they bought, what they bought, how much of the products they bought and for what amount, from where I will bring insights about customers segments, their buying habits and I will give some recommendation where what we could do with each of the segmented group.

### The main question I wanted to answer 

1. How our segmented groups perform and where we need to pay more attention.
2. What suggestions would be for each of the segmented groups in order to increase their engagement.
