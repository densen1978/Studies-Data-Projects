# Funnels 

## Task Description

1. Analyze the data in raw_events table. Spend time querying the table, getting more familiar with data. Identify events captured by users visiting the website.
2. Now that you have your unique events table create a sales funnel chart from events in it. Not all events are relevant, productive to be used in this chart. Identify & collect data that you think could be used

* Use between 4 to 6 types of events in this analysis.
* Create a funnel chart with a country split. Business is interested in the differences between top 3 countries in the funnel chart.
* Top countries are decided by their overall number of events.
* Provide insights if any found.
* See if you can come up with any other ideas/slices for funnel analysis that could be worth a look.

## Results & Conclusions 

The funnels.sql code was utilized to extract data for further analysis. Funnels were generated for the top three countries based on customer count. The top three countries exhibit significant differences primarily in the number of engaged customers. However, the percentages of customer drop-off throughout the events remain relatively consistent despite the variations in countries.

## Conclusions

- From the data, it is evident that the majority of customers are from the United States.

- Upon initial inspection, we observe that only a small fraction of users delve deeper and search for specific items on our website.

- Comparing the 'view item' stage to other stages, it becomes apparent that a minority of users proceed to add items to the cart. This suggests that our product may not meet all the requirements for customers to progress further.

- A significant number of visitors are leaving our website after viewing the page without exploring further for specific items. This could imply that users struggle to find the items they are looking for. Further analysis is needed to understand how we can enhance the first page to retain customers.

- Following item views, notably fewer users proceed to add the product to the cart and complete the purchase. This may indicate a few possibilities, such as users finding the product but considering the price too high, or the discovered product not meeting all the requirements to fulfill customer needs. Further analysis is necessary to determine the information users seek on the site in order to retain more customers interested in purchasing our products.
