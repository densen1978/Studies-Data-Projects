# Risk Analysis 

## Introduction
The final Basel III framework will be implemented on 1 of January 2024. Your manager asks you to calculate credit risk RWA and capital requirement for the bank's portfolio. 

## Task requirements
You must use data from the file Mortgage_default, which contains loans with a status indicator: defaulted(bad) or non-defaulted. Here is short description of data columns:

BAD: 1 = applicant defaulted on loan or seriously delinquent; 0 = applicant paid loan.
MORTDUE: Amount due on existing mortgage.
VALUE: Value of current property.
JOB: Occupational categories.
YOJ: Years at present job.
DEROG: Number of major derogatory reports.
DELINQ: Number of delinquent credit lines.
CLAGE: Age of oldest credit line in months.
NINQ: Number of recent credit inquiries.
CLNO: Number of credit lines.
DEBTINC: Debt-to-income ratio.

Detailed columns description is provided here.

As you have practiced in your hands on task, now you must calculate credit risk RWA for the given data under both: standardized (follow the regulation, as in the hands-on task) and IRB approach and compare the results. 


## Main Objectives 

For the business to understand default risk applying different risk assessment approaches I had several objectives. 

•	Calculate credit risk weight using both standartized and internal ratings based (IRB approach)
•	Identify the most / least risky assets in the mortage portfolio
•	Compare to approaches and provide recommendation for usage and decreasing RWA

By achieving them we will have a better understanding of our customers and what approach is better for our financial institution.
