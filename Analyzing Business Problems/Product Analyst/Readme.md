# Product Analysis 

In the world of e-commerce, understanding how much time it takes for users to make a purchase on our website is vital. This analysis helps us see how efficient our website is and identify areas for improvement.

Our product manager wants us to measure and analyze the time from a user's first visit to their first purchase each day. This data will help us refine our marketing strategies and improve the overall user experience.

In this analysis, we'll explain our methods and share insights on user purchase times to enhance our website's performance and better understanding of users behavior.

## Main Questions 

#### How purchase times differ in different periods?: 
-  Analyzing how the time it takes for users to make their first purchase changes throughout the year can reveal seasonal patterns and highlight months when users tend to convert more quickly. This information can guide our inventory management, marketing campaign timing, and product launches.

#### How purchase times differ on weekdays? 
- Examining user purchase duration across weekdays can help us identify if specific days of the week are associated with faster or slower conversions. This insight can influence our promotional scheduling, customer engagement strategies, and staffing levels for customer support.

#### How do user purchase times differ in different parts of the day? 
- Splitting the day into segments, such as morning, afternoon, and evening, can reveal when users are more likely to make their first purchase. This information can be used to refine ad placement, email marketing schedules, and customer service availability for maximum impact.

#### How do purchase times differ per country? 
- Understanding how user purchase duration differs by country is crucial for tailoring our global strategy. Are there cultural or regional factors influencing this duration? By identifying these variations, we can optimize pricing, localization efforts, and customer support to improve user experiences.
