# Product Analysis using Python for data analytics

In this project, I conducted product analysis using Python, accomplishing the following tasks:

- Formulated crucial questions for the business.
- Processed and prepared raw events data for further analysis.
- Generated charts to address the main questions.
- Shared key insights derived from the completed analysis.
