# Logistic regression using Python for data analytics

In this project I conducted to create a logistic regression model and to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The data is given in the sheet Heart_desease. The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. The data attributes are described in Heart_desease_desc sheet.

The uploaded file of the report could be found [here](https://github.com/densen1978/Studies-Data-Projects/blob/main/Python%20for%20Data%20Analytics/Logistic%20regression%20with%20Python%20(imbalanced%20dataset).ipynb)
